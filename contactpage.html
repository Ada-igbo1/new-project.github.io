        <p> Thank you for perusing my website. This is my first website ever. I created it using all that I've learnt 
            from this program. I sincerely appreciate IBM, our host Mr Jimi Agoro and all our wonderful tutors that have put so 
            much effort into this. I also thank my co-learners for making the IBM office a fun place to be.

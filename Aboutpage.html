<p> <u> DAY 1 </u></p> 
<p> The first day was very interesting. That was when we started building this website. 
    Met Mr. Jimi in person too on this day. Very nice guy. Also met my fellow physical learners. 
    It was fun and educating. Below is a picture from day 1.</p>

<p><u> DAY 2 </u></p>
<p> Day 2 was also very nice. 
    We all came in before classes started by 11am and we had some time to bond with each other. Classes were very nice
and interactive and this is when we started to flash out our websites. Here is a video from day 2.</p>

<p><u> DAY 3 </u></p> 
<p>Our websites are beginning to take on shape. We started CSS and now we can add style and color to our different pages.
    All our tutors are awesome. Our Business Analysis classes are particularly interactive. We got to talk about
     and solve problem-scenarios and see first hand how the BA process works. Here's a picture from day 3.

<p><u> DAY 4 </u></p>
<p> This was a rainy day and it was quite cold lol, so we were pretty much shivering. But we had hot coffees and hot 
    chocolates to warm us and and we started our classes. It was another day of gaining much knowledge. Here's
    a picture taken on the 4th day.
